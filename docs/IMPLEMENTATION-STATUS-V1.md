## Historical Build Status

Build 02–05 code remains removed from the active tree because it predates the frozen Bootstrap/component/icon/content/SEO architecture.

Historical value remains in Git history and selected reference/source-map files. It is not current implementation progress and must not be restored as active code.

## Page Production Gate

**M1 PASSED / CLOSED.** Page production is now open under the normal per-page gates.

PG01 has completed its immediate entry requirements:
- Content C6 — FROZEN.
- Page Design Profile prepared and approved for implementation.
- SEO & Page Identity Contract included in the profile.
- component map uses the M1 registered system.
- demo/legal and asset rules are explicit.

Next execution action: build PG01 Arabic + English together, then Content C7 → page QA → C8.

## Update Rule

Update this tracker in the same work unit whenever a milestone, foundation unit or page changes state.
